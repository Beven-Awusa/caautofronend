# Issue #010: Car Makes, Models, and Features CRUD System

## Branch Name
`feature/car-reference-data-crud`

## Description

Implement a comprehensive Car Makes, Models, and Features CRUD system for the caautoline automotive marketplace. This system should handle reference data management including car manufacturers (makes), car models, and car features with full CRUD operations.

The system needs to support:
- Full CRUD operations for car makes
- Full CRUD operations for car models
- Full CRUD operations for car features
- Proper relationships between makes and models
- Categorization of features
- Active/inactive status management

This reference data will be used across the platform for filtering, searching, and categorizing car listings and accessories.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Create API endpoints for car makes data with full CRUD operations
- [ ] Create API endpoints for car models data with full CRUD operations
- [ ] Create API endpoints for car features data with full CRUD operations
- [ ] Implement proper relationships between makes and models
- [ ] Implement feature categorization
- [ ] Implement active/inactive status management for all entities
- [ ] Return appropriate success/error responses with proper HTTP status codes
- [ ] Validate all input data using class-validator decorators
- [ ] Create comprehensive unit and integration tests

## Technical Requirements

### Database Schema
Refer to the backend structure documentation for the complete database schema. The following tables are required:

- `car_makes` table - Car manufacturer data
- `car_models` table - Car model data
- `car_features` table - Car feature data

### NestJS Implementation Structure

The implementation should follow NestJS best practices with proper module organization:
- Reference data module with services for makes, models, and features
- Common utilities for validation and error handling
